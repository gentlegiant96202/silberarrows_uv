REFUND REQUEST - PREMIUM LISTING PLACEMENT ISSUE
================================================================================

Re: Request for Credit Refund Due to Premium Listing Malfunction

================================================================================

Dear Dubizzle Team,

We hope this message finds you well. We're reaching out regarding a technical
issue we've noticed with our premium listings and would appreciate your
assistance in resolving this matter.


THE ISSUE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since at least October 1st, 2025 (possibly earlier - we're not certain when this
started), we've observed that our premium and featured listings are not appearing
at the top of search results as expected:

  Expected: Premium listings appear at top of page 1
  Observed: Premium listings appear on page 2, then disappear after a few hours

This has led us to repeatedly refresh the same listings multiple times, hoping
to achieve the top placement we've paid for.


CREDIT CONSUMPTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Period Analyzed: October 1-8, 2025
Total Credits Used: 13,232 credits (127 transactions)

Premium Services Affected:
  • Premium Refresh: 6,174 credits (53 transactions)
  • Premium: 2,798 credits (10 transactions)
  • Featured: 874 credits (8 transactions)
  • Featured Refresh: 476 credits (10 transactions)
  
  Total Premium: 10,322 credits


EVIDENCE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've identified 16 individual listings that required 3-7 premium refreshes each
within just 8 days. For example:

  • One Mercedes E-Class: 7 premium charges (913 credits) in 6 days
  • S63 AMG Coupe: 4 premium charges (792 credits) in 3 days
  • Mercedes A-Class: 5 premium charges (758 credits) in 6 days

This pattern suggests a technical issue rather than normal usage, as premium
placement should not require this many refreshes.


REQUEST:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We kindly request a refund of 10,322 credits for premium services that did not
deliver the expected top placement during this period.

We value our partnership with Dubizzle and the quality leads your platform
provides. We're confident this is a technical issue that your team can resolve,
and we look forward to continuing to use your premium services once this is
corrected.


SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attached:
  • Complete transaction log (127 transactions)
  • Evidence document (16 affected listings)
  • Transaction data in CSV format


We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your
response.

Best regards,
