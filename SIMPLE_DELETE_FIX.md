# ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLE FILE DELETION FIX

## The Problem
Files aren't being deleted because there are multiple places modifying the media arrays, causing conflicts.

## Simple Solution
Let me create a minimal, direct fix that just works.

## Test This
1. Open Myth Buster Monday modal
2. Click delete on any file
3. File should disappear immediately
4. Close and reopen modal - file should stay deleted

If this doesn't work, we'll try a different approach.
