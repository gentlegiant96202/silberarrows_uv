-- ================================
-- EMERGENCY FIX - BYPASS RLS TEMPORARILY
-- ================================
-- This will temporarily disable RLS to fix the 500 errors

-- Step 1: Temporarily disable RLS to fix access issues
ALTER TABLE user_roles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Ensure current user exists and is admin
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT auth.uid(), 'admin'
WHERE auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
ON CONFLICT (user_id) 
DO UPDATE SET role = 'admin', updated_at = NOW();

-- Step 3: Verify your access
SELECT 
  'Current user status:' as info,
  auth.uid() as user_id,
  (SELECT role FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()) as database_role,
  is_user_admin(auth.uid()) as is_admin_function_result;

-- Step 4: Show all users for debugging
SELECT 'All users in user_roles:' as info;
SELECT user_id, role, created_at FROM user_roles ORDER BY created_at;

-- Step 5: Re-enable RLS with a simpler policy
ALTER TABLE user_roles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own role" ON user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own role" ON user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all roles" ON user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all roles" ON user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can insert roles" ON user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own role" ON user_roles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Debug: Allow all authenticated reads" ON user_roles;

-- Create one simple policy that allows everything for now
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON user_roles
  FOR ALL 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Step 6: Test access after re-enabling RLS
SELECT 'Testing access after RLS re-enabled:' as test;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rows FROM user_roles;
SELECT role FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Step 7: Final verification
SELECT 
  '=== EMERGENCY FIX COMPLETE ===' as status,
  auth.uid() as your_user_id,
  (SELECT role FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()) as your_role,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_roles) as total_users_with_roles;
