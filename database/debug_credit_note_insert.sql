-- üîç DEBUG CREDIT NOTE INSERT
-- This will help us see what values are being inserted

-- Let's check what happens when we try to insert a credit note manually
-- First, let's see what a typical charge looks like
SELECT 
    id,
    charge_type,
    total_amount,
    unit_price,

WHERE charge_type = 'salik' 
  AND status = 'invoiced'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
LIMIT 1;

-- Now let's test inserting a credit note manually with the same logic
-- (This is just for debugging - don't run this in production)
