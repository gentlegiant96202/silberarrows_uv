-- STEP 2: For October 2025 specifically, show daily progression
SELECT

-- STEP 3: Simple analysis - if we ONLY have October data

ðŸ“Š RESULTS INTERPRETATION:
- If you only have October 2025 data, we cannot use historical pattern
- Alternative: Use industry benchmarks or manual % input
- Typical service industry end-of-month surge: 20-30% in last 2 days
- Recommendation: Track for 2-3 months then enable pattern forecasting
