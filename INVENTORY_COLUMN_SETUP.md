Added an "INVENTORY" column to the Leasing Inventory Kanban board, positioned between "MARKETING" and "RESERVED" columns.

## âœ… Frontend Changes Completed

### 1. **LeasingInventoryBoard.tsx Updates**
- âœ… Added `'inventory'` to `VehicleStatus` type
- âœ… Added inventory column to `columns` array with `LayoutGrid` icon
- âœ… Added inventory to `columnLoading` state initialization
- âœ… Added inventory to `columnData` state initialization

- **Icon**: `LayoutGrid` (grid icon)
- **Color**: Purple (`bg-purple-500/20 text-purple-300`)
- **Position**: Second column (after Marketing)

## ðŸ”§ Database Migration Required

### **Step 1: Run the Database Migration**

Execute the SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- File: add_inventory_status_to_leasing.sql
-- This adds 'inventory' to the leasing_vehicle_status_enum
```

### **Step 2: Verify the Migration**

After running the migration, verify:
- The enum includes all values: `marketing`, `inventory`, `reserved`, `leased`, `returned`, `maintenance`, `archived`
- Existing vehicles maintain their current status
- New vehicles can be set to `inventory` status

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

### **Inventory Column Functionality**
- âœ… **Drag & Drop**: Vehicles can be moved to/from inventory column
- âœ… **Progressive Loading**: Loads after marketing column (80ms delay)
- âœ… **Status Tracking**: Purple badge shows "INVENTORY" status
- âœ… **Full Integration**: Works with all existing Kanban features

### **Use Case**
The inventory column represents vehicles that are:
- Ready for leasing (moved from marketing)
- Available in inventory but not yet reserved
- Prepared and processed for customer assignment

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** (`add_inventory_status_to_leasing.sql`)
2. **Test the new column** by moving vehicles between statuses
3. **Verify drag & drop** functionality works correctly
4. **Check progressive loading** shows inventory column after marketing

## ðŸ“Š Status Flow

```
MARKETING â†’ INVENTORY â†’ RESERVED â†’ LEASED
                â†“
            MAINTENANCE
                â†“
            RETURNED â†’ ARCHIVED
```

The inventory column fits naturally into the leasing workflow as the staging area for vehicles ready to be reserved by customers.
