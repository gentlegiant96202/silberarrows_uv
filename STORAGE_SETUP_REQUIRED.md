# üöÄ STORAGE BUCKET SETUP REQUIRED

## üìã OVERVIEW
The Service Contracts system now includes **PDF storage functionality** that requires a Supabase storage bucket to be created.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SETUP STEP

### Create Storage Bucket in Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Navigate to Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Click "Create Bucket"**
3. **Bucket Configuration:**
   - **Name:** `service-documents`
   - **Public:** ‚úÖ **YES** (Enable public access)
   - **File Size Limit:** `50MB` (for PDF files)
   - **Allowed MIME Types:** `application/pdf`

### Storage Policies (Optional):
If you want to restrict access, you can add RLS policies to the bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload PDFs
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'service-documents' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public read access to PDFs
CREATE POLICY "Allow public downloads" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'service-documents');
```

## üéØ WHAT THIS ENABLES

### ‚úÖ **PDF Storage & Access:**
- **Automatic PDF Upload** - Generated contracts are stored in Supabase
- **Persistent PDF URLs** - Access contracts anytime from database
- **PDF Download Buttons** - View/download PDFs from contract details
- **Audit Trail** - PDF URLs logged in contract activities

### ‚úÖ **Current Functionality:**
- **Contract Creation** ‚úÖ Working with database storage
- **PDF Generation** ‚úÖ Working with local download
- **Contract Viewing** ‚úÖ Full contract details modal
- **Status Changes** ‚úÖ Update contract status with activity logging
- **Contract Search** ‚úÖ Filter by reference, customer, vehicle, VIN

## üö® **UNTIL BUCKET IS CREATED:**
- Contracts will still be created and stored in database
- PDFs will still generate and download locally
- PDF storage will fail silently (logged in console)
- Contract details modal will show "No PDF available"

## ‚úÖ **AFTER BUCKET IS CREATED:**
- All new contracts will have stored PDFs
- PDF download buttons will work in contract details
- Complete audit trail with PDF URLs
- Professional contract management system fully operational

---

**üéâ Once the storage bucket is created, your Service Contracts system will be 100% complete!**
