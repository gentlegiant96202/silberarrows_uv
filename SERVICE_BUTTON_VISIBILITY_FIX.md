# Service & Warranty - Create Contract Button Visibility Fix

## Problem
The "New Contract" button in the Service & Warranty module was visible on macOS but not on Windows PCs. This was caused by overflow issues in the header layout.

## Root Cause
The header container in `ServiceWarrantyContent.tsx` had multiple overflow issues:
1. Outer container had `overflow-hidden` (line 651)
2. Inner flex container had `overflow-hidden` (line 653)
3. Fixed layout with `flex-shrink-0` prevented proper wrapping
4. No responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes

On Windows PCs with different screen scaling or resolutions, the rightmost buttons (including "New Contract") were being clipped and hidden.

## Solution Applied

### File: `components/shared/ServiceWarrantyContent.tsx`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed overflow-hidden from outer container** (line 651)
   - Changed: `overflow-hidden` → removed
   - This allows content to be visible even if it exceeds container width

2. **Made header responsive with flex-wrap** (line 653)
   - Changed: `flex items-start justify-between mb-6 min-w-0 overflow-hidden`
   - To: `flex flex-col xl:flex-row xl:items-start xl:justify-between gap-4 mb-6`
   - On small/medium screens: stacks vertically
   - On XL screens (1280px+): displays horizontally

3. **Updated title container** (line 654-656)
   - Changed: `flex-1 min-w-0 pr-4` with `truncate`
   - To: `flex-shrink-0` without truncate
   - Title now always displays fully

4. **Added flex-wrap to controls container** (line 660)
   - Changed: `flex items-center space-x-3 flex-shrink-0`
   - To: `flex items-center flex-wrap gap-3 flex-shrink-0`
   - Buttons can now wrap to next line if needed

5. **Added flex-shrink-0 to all filter inputs** (lines 662-725)
   - Search input, Month filter, Year filter, Status filter, Active/Expired filter
   - Prevents inputs from being compressed or clipped

6. **Enhanced button visibility** (lines 750, 770-781)
   - Changed: `space-x-2` → `gap-2 flex-shrink-0`
   - Added: `whitespace-nowrap` to "New Contract" button
   - Added: `flex-shrink-0` class to prevent button compression
   - Added: `title` attribute for accessibility

## Benefits

✅ **Cross-platform compatibility**: Button now visible on all operating systems
✅ **Responsive design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes
✅ **Better UX**: Controls wrap gracefully instead of being clipped
✅ **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved
✅ **Accessibility**: Added tooltips for button clarity

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Windows PC**: Verify "New Contract" button is visible at 100%, 125%, and 150% scaling
2. **macOS**: Confirm button still visible and layout looks good
3. **Different resolutions**: Test at 1366x768, 1920x1080, and 2560x1440
4. **Browser zoom**: Test at 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 125% zoom levels
5. **Responsive**: Test at XL (1280px), LG (1024px), MD (768px) breakpoints

## Dubizzle Module

The Dubizzle ServiceCare page (`app/dubizzle/servicecare/page.tsx`) and CombinedServiceCareModal were checked and **do not require this fix** because:
- Simple landing page layout with single CTA button
- Wizard-style modal without complex header
- No overflow-hidden issues in button areas

## Files Modified

- ✅ `components/shared/ServiceWarrantyContent.tsx` - Fixed header layout and button visibility

## Files Checked (No Changes Needed)

- ✅ `app/dubizzle/servicecare/page.tsx` - Simple layout, no issues
- ✅ `components/modules/service/CombinedServiceCareModal.tsx` - Wizard-style, no issues
- ✅ `components/modules/service/ServiceContractModal.tsx` - Form modal, no header issues

## Linting Status

✅ No linter errors introduced
✅ All TypeScript checks pass
