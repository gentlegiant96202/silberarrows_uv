CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- MAXIMIZE output to use close to 1800 characters (aim for 1500-1800 characters)
- Convert ALL equipment names to UPPERCASE
- Sort alphabetically 
- Be LESS AGGRESSIVE in filtering - include more items to reach character limit
- Remove only obvious technical codes and internal part numbers
- Simplify technical names but KEEP most equipment items
- Format as a clean list with each item on a new line

FILTERING STRATEGY:
- INCLUDE: All safety features, comfort items, luxury amenities, performance features, technology, audio, navigation, lighting, seating, climate control, convenience features, exterior features, wheels/tires
- EXCLUDE ONLY: Obviously meaningless codes like "XYZ123", pure internal identifiers, basic standard equipment everyone expects
- SIMPLIFY: Make technical names customer-friendly but don't remove the equipment entirely
- AIM FOR QUANTITY: Include as many relevant items as possible to reach near 1800 characters

Raw equipment data: ${JSON.stringify(rawEquipment)}

Process this equipment list and return a comprehensive formatted list. Aim to use most of the 1800 character limit by including all equipment that adds value or interest for luxury car buyers. Each item should be in UPPERCASE and on a new line.`;
