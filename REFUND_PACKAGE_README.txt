YOUR REFUND CASE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üìÖ Period: October 1-8, 2025 (8 days only)
üí∞ Total Credits Wasted: 13,232 credits
üéØ Refund Amount Requested: 10,322 credits (premium services only)
üìä Transactions Affected: 127

THE GLITCH EXPLAINED:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you pay for "Premium" or "Premium Refresh" on Dubizzle:
  
  ‚úÖ WHAT YOU PAID FOR:
     - Listing appears at TOP of search results
     - Maximum visibility to buyers
     - Listing stays active and visible
  
  ‚ùå WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GOT:
     - Listing appears on PAGE 2 (buried, no visibility)
     - Listing DISAPPEARS completely after a few hours
     - Zero benefit from premium spend

Result: You were forced to keep buying premium refreshes over and over for the
same vehicles, trying to get the top placement you already paid for.


KEY EVIDENCE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚Ä¢ 16 vehicles were charged 3+ premium fees each
‚Ä¢ One single vehicle: 913 credits (charged 7 times for premium)
‚Ä¢ October 4th spike: 4,093 credits in ONE day (desperate refresh attempts)
‚Ä¢ Pattern proves glitch: Same listings charged repeatedly within hours/days


STRONGEST EVIDENCE EXAMPLES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Mercedes E-Class (ID: 5bb60202):
   - 8 transactions over 6 days
   - 7 premium charges = 913 credits
   - Should have needed only 1 premium charge

2. S63 AMG Coupe (ID: 2f6eefa346):
   - 5 transactions over 3 days
   - 4 premium charges = 792 credits
   - Kept disappearing, forcing re-promotion

3. Mercedes A-Class (ID: ec4077ac):
   - 6 transactions over 6 days
   - 5 premium charges = 758 credits
   - Clear pattern of glitch-induced repeat charges
