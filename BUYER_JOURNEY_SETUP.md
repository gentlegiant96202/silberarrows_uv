## Database Setup

### Step 1: Create Database Tables
Run the following SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash

```

This will create:

- RLS policies for security
- Realtime subscriptions
- Indexes for performance

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

```bash
create_buyer_journey_storage.sql
```

**Alternative:** You can also create the storage bucket manually in the Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Create Bucket"
