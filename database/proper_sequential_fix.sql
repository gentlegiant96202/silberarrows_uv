-- ðŸ”§ PROPER SEQUENTIAL INVOICE NUMBER FIX

-- 1. First, let's see what invoice numbers actually exist
SELECT 
    'Existing invoice numbers:' as info,
    invoice_number,
    CAST(SUBSTRING(invoice_number FROM 'INV-LE-(\d+)') AS INTEGER) as number_part
FROM ifrs_lease_accounting 
WHERE invoice_number LIKE 'INV-LE-%' 
AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING(invoice_number FROM 'INV-LE-(\d+)') AS INTEGER);

-- 2. Find the actual highest number
SELECT 
    'Actual highest number:' as info,
    MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(invoice_number FROM 'INV-LE-(\d+)') AS INTEGER)) as max_number
FROM ifrs_lease_accounting 
WHERE invoice_number LIKE 'INV-LE-%' 
AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- 3. Drop and recreate the function with better logic
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ifrs_generate_invoice(UUID, DATE, UUID[]);
