-- =====================================================
-- RESULTS INTERPRETATION
-- =====================================================
/*
WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
=================

QUERY 2 & 3 (Most Important):
- If you see media with car_id that's NOT 19e93a06-d309-4e9d-9ba7-f0da0cb07c02
- That car_id is your ORIGINAL DELETED EQS!
- Look for entries with "ðŸŽ¯ MATCHES STOCK 023656" or "âš¡ EQS RELATED"

QUERY 5:
- Shows deleted_car_uuid with most media
- If one car has many photos, it's likely your deleted EQS

QUERY 6:
- Shows all media from the car with most orphaned files
- Check if these look like EQS photos

QUERY 7:
- UV catalog might still reference the deleted car
- Shows you the deleted car's details

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Look for any car_id that appears in these results
2. That UUID is your original deleted EQS
3. We can then search all tables for that UUID
4. Contact the user who was active around that time (baca06fa...)

NO RESULTS?
===========
If all queries return empty:
- The car and ALL its media were completely cleaned up
- Check with user baca06fa-90e8-465e-96b7-d2693e5a949c directly
- They likely know what happened
